# FireBaseUi

Easily add sign-in to your Android app with FirebaseUI

FirebaseUI is a library built on top of the Firebase Authentication SDK that provides drop-in UI flows for use in your app. FirebaseUI provides the following benefits:

Multiple Providers - sign-in flows for email/password, email link, phone authentication, Google Sign-In, Facebook Login, Twitter Login, and GitHub Login.
Account Management - flows to handle account management tasks, such as account creation and password resets.
Account Linking - flows to safely link user accounts across identity providers.
Anonymous User Upgrading - flows to safely upgrade anonymous users.
Custom Themes - customize the look of FirebaseUI to match your app. Also, because FirebaseUI is open source, you can fork the project and customize it exactly to your needs.
Smart Lock for Passwords - automatic integration with Smart Lock for Passwords for fast cross-device sign-in.
